I guess, you forget to change this questions, since it is still queue

Time complexity of each function in the Queue class:
- enqueue: O(n)
- dequeue: O(1)
- isEmpty: O(1)
- size: O(1)

Time complexity of the generateBinaryQueue() function: O(n)

Time complexity of the reverseKElementsInQueue() function: O(n)

Time complexity of each function in the DoubleEndedQueue class: 
- insertFront() — O(1)
- insertRear() — O(1)
- deleteFront() — O(1)
- deleteRear() — O(1)
- getFront() — O(1)
- getRear() — O(1)
- isEmpty() — O(1)
- size() — O(1)

Time complexity of the slidingWindowMaximum() function: - O(n)
